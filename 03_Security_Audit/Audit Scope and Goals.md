**Audit Scope and Goals**

**Summary:** The internal audit needs to align current business
practices with industry standards and best practices. The audit is meant
to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are
classified as "high risk," and present an overall strategy to improve
the security posture of the organization. The audit team needs to
document their findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and
communicate with stakeholders.

**Scope:** The internal IT audit will assess the following:

-   Assess user permissions

-   Identify existing controls, procedures, and system protocols

-   Account for technology currently in use

**Goals:** The goals for the internal IT audit are:

-   Adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

-   Establish policies and procedures to ensure compliance with
    > regulations

-   Fortify system controls

**Risk Assessment**

## Current assets

Assets managed by the IT Department include:

-   Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops,
    > smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards,
    > mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.

-   Internal network: protected storage of customer, vendor,
    > organizational data

## Risk description

Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally,
proper controls are not in place and the organization may not be
compliant with U.S. and international compliance regulations and
standards.

## Control best practices

The organization will need to dedicate resources to managing assets.
Additionally, they will need to determine the impact of the loss of
existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

## Risk score

On a scale of 1-10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is
due to a lack of controls and adherence to necessary compliance
regulations and standards.

## Additional comments

The likelihood of a lost asset or fines from governing bodies is high
because the organization does not have all of the necessary controls in
place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards related
to keeping PII data private.
