This section is *optional* and can be used to provide a summary of
recommendations to the IT manager regarding which controls and/or
compliance best practices Botium Toys needs to implement, based on the
risk posed if not implemented in a timely manner.

**Recommendations (optional):** In this section, provide
recommendations, related to controls and/or compliance needs, that your
IT manager could communicate to stakeholders to reduce risks to assets
and improve Botium Toys' security posture.

**1. Implement Technical Safeguards**

-   **Establish Least Privilege access controls** to reduce unnecessary
    > permissions and mitigate insider threats.

-   **Deploy encryption** for sensitive data at rest and in transit to
    > align with PCI DSS and GDPR requirements.

-   **Install or update firewall and IDS tools** to detect and block
    > malicious traffic.

-   **Introduce centralized password management tools** and enforce
    > strong password policies across all user accounts.

-   **Ensure antivirus software is installed and regularly updated** on
    > all endpoints.

**2. Improve Business Continuity and Disaster Preparedness**

-   **Develop a formal disaster recovery plan**, including regular
    > backups and documented recovery procedures.

-   **Verify that backup systems are secure, redundant, and tested
    > periodically.\
    > **

-   **Create incident response playbooks** and designate clear
    > responsibilities.

**3. Align with Compliance Standards**

-   **PCI DSS**: Ensure credit card data is encrypted, processed
    > securely, and accessed only by authorized personnel. Adopt and
    > enforce secure password policies.

-   **GDPR**: Classify and inventory all personal data. Implement breach
    > notification plans (e.g., within 72 hours for E.U. customers).
    > Document privacy procedures and access logs.

-   **SOC 1/2**: Define and document user access policies. Ensure data
    > is consistently available and validated for integrity and
    > confidentiality.
