| **Contents**       | Write **2-3 sentences** about the types of      |
|                    | information found on this device.               |
|                    |                                                 |

|                    |                                                 |

|                    | *This USB contains a mix of both PII (like      |
|                    | family photos, vacation ideas, wedding list)    |
|                    | and sensitive work files (a new hire letter,    |
|                    | employee schedule). It is best practice to keep |
|                    | personal and work files stored separately.*     |

|                    | software is installed onto a work computer in   |
|                    | the background. Because it contains personal    |
|                    | info such as a wedding list and family photos,  |
|                    | it can be used to attack a person's relatives.* |

|                    | awareness training on keeping personal and work |
|                    | related files stored separately. Technical      |

|                    | anti-spyware and antivirus software can help in |

|                    | malicious software from plugged in devices like |
|                    | USBs. Also make sure that proper encryption and |
