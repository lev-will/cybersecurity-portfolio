# **Threat Modeling - README**

## **Overview**

This folder contains exercises focused on identifying and analyzing
potential threats to systems and data using structured threat modeling
techniques. It includes scenario-based analysis and application of the
PASTA framework to simulate realistic threat environments.

## **Contents**

**Parking lot USB exercise\
** A threat scenario involving a malicious USB device left in a public
space. Analyzes social engineering risks and insider threat vectors.

**PASTA worksheet\
** A step-by-step worksheet for conducting threat modeling using the
PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) methodology.

## **How to Use**

Begin with the Parking Lot USB scenario to explore human-centered attack
vectors and evaluate response strategies. Then complete the PASTA
worksheet to walk through a full threat modeling lifecycle, identifying
business objectives, threat actors, and attack paths. These resources
build foundational skills in proactive threat analysis and security
planning.
