# **Linux SQL - README**

## **Overview**

This folder contains practical exercises using Linux and SQL to
investigate system activity and apply basic security principles. These
activities support foundational skills in system-level analysis and
access control.

## **Contents**

-   **Apply filters to SQL queries** -- Demonstrates the use of SQL
    > filtering commands to investigate suspicious login activity,
    > including failed attempts, geographic anomalies, and specific
    > dates.

-   **File permissions in Linux** -- Explains how to interpret and
    > modify Linux file permissions using chmod, chown, and symbolic
    > notation. Useful for understanding file access and enforcing the
    > principle of least privilege.

## **How to Use**

Use the SQL query exercise to explore how filtered data can reveal
patterns of potential misuse or attempted breaches. The Linux
permissions exercise reinforces access control concepts in Unix-like
environments. Together, these resources build foundational skills for
detecting, analyzing, and mitigating low-level system risks.
