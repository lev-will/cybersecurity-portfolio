# **Incident Response - README**

## **Overview**

This folder contains resources, reports, templates, and exercises
related to cybersecurity incident response and network traffic analysis.
These materials are designed to help identify, investigate, document,
and respond to security incidents through hands-on tools and real-world
examples.

## **Contents**

**Brute force attack - incident report\
** A completed example of an incident report documenting a brute force
attack, including findings and response actions.

**Cybersecurity incident report - blank\
** A reusable template for documenting any cybersecurity incident,
ensuring consistent and thorough reporting.

**Incident report analysis-blank\
** A blank template for analyzing incident reports, useful for
post-incident reviews and lessons learned.

**Wireshark Network Traffic Incident Report\

## **How to Use**

Start by reviewing the completed incident reports for examples of how to
structure your own response. Use the blank templates to document and
analyze new incidents. Wireshark and tcpdump resources provide practical
tools for identifying malicious traffic and conducting root cause
analysis. The access control worksheet and data leak template help
assess internal misconfigurations or accidental exposures, ensuring
incidents are followed by thorough corrective action.
